**Helm** is the **"package manager for Kubernetes,"** often compared to `apt` for Ubuntu or `yum` for CentOS.

### Key Things to Remember:

1. **It simplifies Kubernetes application management:** Instead of managing multiple complex YAML files for deployments, services, config maps, etc., Helm bundles them all into a single, versioned package called a **Chart**.
2. **It uses a templating engine:** A Helm **chart** is a collection of template files. This allows you to parameterize your Kubernetes manifests, so you can easily customize deployments for different environments (dev, staging, prod) using a `values.yaml` file.

### Core Components:

- **Charts:** Pre-configured Kubernetes resource packages (the package itself).
- **Releases:** A deployed instance of a chart, with a specific configuration.
- **Helm Client:** The command-line tool (`helm`).
- **Tiller (Deprecated):** Was the server-side component. Modern Helm (v3+) does not require Tiller, making it more secure and simple.
    

**In short: Helm helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.**
