FinOps stands for "Financial Operations" (or sometimes "Cloud Financial Management")
It's a framework and practice used mainly in cloud computing to help organization control, optimize, and get business values out of their cloud spending.

**Definition**:
FinOps is a cultural practice that combines finance, operations, and engineering teams to manage cloud costs effectively.

Why it matters?
In the cloud, costs scale dynamically (pay-as-you-go). Without FinOps, businesses risk overspending or not linking costs to business value.

Example of FinOps activites:
- Rightsizing instances (choosing the right VM size).
- Turning off idle resources.
- Using Reserved Instances/Saving Plans for predictable workloads.
- Setting up cost alerts and budget in AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- Allocating costs per team or project (Chargeback/showback)
