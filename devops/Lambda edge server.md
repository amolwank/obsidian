### 🔹 **What is Lambda@Edge?**

**Lambda@Edge** is an **extension of AWS Lambda** that lets you run your code **closer to users** by deploying it on **AWS CloudFront edge locations** worldwide.

Instead of running only in a single AWS region, your function executes at the nearest edge server to the user, reducing latency and improving performance.

---

### 🔹 **Why it’s used (Need):**

- Customize content delivered by CloudFront.
    
- Reduce latency by executing logic near the end-user.
    
- Add security or personalization without changing the origin server.
    

---

### 🔹 **Common Use Cases:**

1. **Security** – Block requests from specific IPs or countries.
    
2. **Personalization** – Show content based on cookies, headers, or device type.
    
3. **SEO/Redirects** – URL rewrites or redirects at the edge.
    
4. **Authentication** – Validate JWT tokens before forwarding requests.
    
5. **A/B Testing** – Serve different versions of content to different users.

### 🔹 **How it works:**

- You write a Lambda function.
    
- Associate it with a **CloudFront event**:
    
    - Viewer Request (before CloudFront cache)
        
    - Viewer Response (after CloudFront cache)
        
    - Origin Request (before request goes to origin)
        
    - Origin Response (after origin responds)
        
- Function runs at the **nearest edge location** to the user.

✅ **Interview One-liner:**  
“Lambda@Edge is an extension of AWS Lambda that allows running serverless functions at CloudFront edge locations, enabling low-latency content customization, security, and personalization for users worldwide.”

👉 Do you want me to also prepare a **30-sec, 60-sec, and detailed interview answer** for Lambda@Edge (like we did for provisioners and taint) so you can use depending on time limits?

### ⚡ **30-sec Answer (Quick & Crisp)**

“Lambda@Edge is an extension of AWS Lambda that runs functions at CloudFront edge locations, closer to users. It’s mainly used for customizing content, adding security, or reducing latency without changing the origin server.”

---

### ⚡ **60-sec Answer (Slightly Detailed)**

“Lambda@Edge allows you to run serverless functions at AWS CloudFront edge locations worldwide. This brings the logic closer to users, improving performance and reducing latency. It’s commonly used for request filtering, authentication, URL rewriting, content personalization, and blocking unwanted traffic. Instead of making every request go back to the origin, Lambda@Edge lets you handle logic directly at the edge.”

---

### ⚡ **Detailed Answer (2–3 min)**

“Lambda@Edge is a feature of AWS that extends Lambda to CloudFront’s global edge network. Normally, Lambda functions run in a single AWS region, but with Lambda@Edge, the function is replicated and runs at edge locations near the end-users.

You can attach the function to CloudFront events such as viewer request, viewer response, origin request, and origin response. This makes it possible to intercept and modify requests and responses at different stages.

Typical use cases include content customization (like serving language-specific pages based on headers), URL rewrites and redirects, A/B testing, security filtering (blocking malicious requests), and authentication at the edge. The main advantage is reduced latency and offloading work from your origin server, resulting in better performance and user experience.

In short, it enables **low-latency, globally distributed, serverless logic tied to content delivery.**”
