### **Interview-Ready Answer (45–60 sec)**

_"To manage Terraform state across multiple regions or accounts, I keep separate state files for each environment instead of one big state. For example, each account/region has its own S3 backend with DynamoDB for locking, and I enforce IAM so teams can only access their state. I use reusable Terraform modules, so the same code can deploy VPCs or clusters in different regions just by passing variables. In CI/CD, each environment pipeline points to its own state backend, ensuring isolation, scalability, and no state conflicts."_

### **Problem:**

You want to deploy the **same infrastructure** (say, VPC, EKS, S3 buckets) across **multiple regions or AWS accounts**.  
If you use a **single state file**, you risk conflicts, overwrites, and complexity.
### **Solution: How to Manage State**

1. **Separate State Files per Region/Account**
    
    - Each environment (region/account) gets its **own state file**.
        
    - Example S3 keys:
    ```
    bucket: terraform-states
    key: prod/us-west-2/terraform.tfstate
    key: dev/eu-central-1/terraform.tfstate
    key: shared/prod-account/terraform.tfstate
    ```
- **Workspaces (Optional, for small setups)**
    
    - Use Terraform **workspaces** (`dev`, `stage`, `prod`, or `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`).
        
    - But workspaces are not ideal for **multiple accounts** → better to use **separate backends**.
        
- **Remote Backend (S3 + DynamoDB)**
    
    - Store all state files in a **centralized S3 bucket** with **DynamoDB locking**.
        
    - IAM policies restrict teams to their environment’s state file only.
        
- **Modular Approach**
    
    - Write infra as a **module** (e.g., `vpc_module`, `eks_module`).
        
    - Deploy the same module into **different accounts/regions** by passing variables.
```
module "vpc" {
  source = "../modules/vpc"
  region = "us-east-1"
  cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

module "vpc_west" {
  source = "../modules/vpc"
  region = "us-west-2"
  cidr   = "10.1.0.0/16"
}
```

**CI/CD Pipelines**

- GitHub Actions / Jenkins pipeline runs Terraform with environment-specific variables.
    
- Each pipeline execution targets **only one backend** (region/account).
