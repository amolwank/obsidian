Good question 👍 Let’s break down the **different types of access policies in AWS**.  
In AWS, a _policy_ is a JSON document that defines **permissions** (what actions are allowed/denied on which resources).

## 🔑 Types of AWS Policies

### 1. **Identity-based Policies**

Attached to **IAM identities** (users, groups, or roles).

- **Managed policies**
    
    - **AWS managed**: predefined by AWS (e.g., `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`).
        
    - **Customer managed**: you create and maintain them.
        
- **Inline policies**
    
    - Directly embedded in a single user/role/group (one-to-one).
        

👉 Example:
```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket"
}
```
### 2. **Resource-based Policies**

Attached directly to a **resource** (instead of a user/role).  
Examples:

- **S3 bucket policies**
    
- **SNS topic policies**
    
- **SQS queue policies**
    
- **KMS key policies**
    

👉 Used when you want to allow **cross-account access** or external services.

### 3. **Permissions Boundaries**

- An **advanced feature** for controlling the **maximum permissions** an IAM role or user can get.
    
- Even if you attach a policy that allows everything, the **boundary restricts** it.
    
- Useful in large organizations (delegated admin use case).
    

---

### 4. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**

- Used with **AWS Organizations**.
- Apply to **all accounts** (or OUs) in the organization.
- Define **guardrails** (e.g., “no one in this OU can create EC2 instances in `us-east-1`”).
- They don’t grant permissions, only **restrict**.


---

### 5. **Session Policies**

- Passed in the request when you assume a role (via STS).
    
- Temporarily limit the role’s effective permissions.
    
- Example: federated users who assume a role but need **restricted access** for one session.
    

---

### 6. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

- **Legacy style** (not JSON policies).
    
- Mostly used in **S3 bucket/object-level permissions** and **VPC network ACLs**.
    
- Example: allowing another AWS account to read objects in your S3 bucket.

## 📌 Summary (when to use what)

- **Identity-based policies** → Define what a user/role/service can do.
    
- **Resource-based policies** → Define who can access a resource.
    
- **SCPs** → Organization-wide restrictions.
    
- **Permissions boundaries** → Limit delegated admins’ users/roles.
    
- **Session policies** → Temporary, runtime restrictions.
    
- **ACLs** → Legacy, use only when needed (S3 cross-account, VPC NACLs).
