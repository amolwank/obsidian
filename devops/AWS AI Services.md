I have hands-on experience with multiple AWS AI/ML services depending on the project needs:

- **Amazon Rekognition** – for image and video analysis like face/object detection.
- **Amazon Polly** – for converting text to natural-sounding speech.
- **Amazon Transcribe** – for converting audio into text (speech-to-text).
- **Amazon Comprehend** – for Natural Language Processing (sentiment analysis, entity extraction, topic modeling).
- **Amazon Lex** – for building chatbots and virtual assistants with conversational AI.
- **Amazon Translate** – for real-time language translation.
- **Amazon SageMaker** – for training, tuning, and deploying custom ML models at scale.
- **Amazon Bedrock** – for building generative AI applications without needing to manage infrastructure or train LLMs.
### **Detailed Answer**

In my projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience with a variety of AWS AI services:

- **Amazon Rekognition** – I used it to analyze and classify images/videos, detect objects, and identify inappropriate content for automated moderation.
    
- **Amazon Polly** – I implemented Polly to convert large volumes of text into speech for IVR systems and accessibility use cases.
    
- **Amazon Transcribe** – I applied it for call recordings and meeting audio, converting speech into text to generate searchable transcripts.
    
- **Amazon Comprehend** – I leveraged it for sentiment analysis on customer feedback and entity extraction from unstructured text data.
    
- **Amazon Lex** – I built chatbots that integrate with backend APIs to handle customer queries.
    
- **Amazon Translate** – I used it in multilingual applications to translate user-generated content dynamically.
    
- **Amazon SageMaker** – I utilized SageMaker for training custom ML models, tuning hyperparameters, and deploying them with endpoints for real-time inference.
    
- **Amazon Bedrock** – I’ve started exploring Bedrock for building generative AI apps using foundation models, which reduces the need to manage ML infrastructure.
    

My approach is to map the business requirement to the right service—whether it’s computer vision, NLP, speech, or generative AI—so that the solution is both scalable and cost-effective.![[AWS AI Services Overview.png]]
