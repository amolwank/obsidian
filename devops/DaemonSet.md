Mine:
The Daemonset is kubernetes workload controller, that manages load.
Need to present on all or required node, like to collect logs.

It is designed for deployed background service or agent that run all nodes or subnet of nodes.

Is it available on each node ? or we can specify it on specific nofwhen to have daemonset?
