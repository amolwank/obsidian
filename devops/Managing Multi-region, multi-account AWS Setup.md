## 🌍 Managing Terraform in Multi-Region, Multi-Account AWS

### 1. **Isolate State by Account + Region**

- Use **separate state files** for each account & region (e.g., `prod/us-east-1`, `prod/ap-south-1`).
- Store state in **S3 backend** with DynamoDB locking.
### 2. **Use Workspaces or Directory Structure**
- Option A: **Directory structure** → `accounts/prod/us-east-1/`, `accounts/dev/eu-west-1/`.
- Option B: **Terraform Workspaces** for different environments/regions.
- Directory structure is more explicit and safer for large orgs.
### 3. **Leverage AWS Organizations & Cross-Account Roles**
- Use a **management account** with Terraform pipelines.
- Assume **IAM roles** in child accounts via `provider "aws" { assume_role { ... } }`.
### 4. **Modularize Infrastructure**

- Create **reusable modules** (VPC, EKS, RDS, IAM).
- Pass region/account-specific variables when calling modules.
### 5. **CI/CD for Safe Deployments**
- Use **GitHub Actions or Jenkins** pipelines:
    - Validate → Plan → Approval → Apply.
    - Run plans per account/region in parallel jobs.
### 6. **Secret & Config Management**
- Keep account/region-specific values (like ARNs, CIDRs) in **Terraform variables** (e.g., `.tfvars` files) or **SSM Parameter Store/Secrets Manager**.
### 7. **Drift & Compliance Control**

- Enable `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` in CI for drift detection.
- Use **OPA/Conftest or Sentinel** for compliance (e.g., enforce encryption across accounts).

## 🎯 Example Answer (Concise for Interview)

> “In a multi-account, multi-region AWS setup, I organize Terraform using separate state files per account and region, stored in an S3 backend with DynamoDB for locking. I use reusable modules for resources like VPC, EKS, and RDS, and manage account access via cross-account IAM roles. Deployments run through CI/CD pipelines like GitHub Actions, which enforce plan reviews and prevent direct applies from laptops. For compliance, I integrate policy checks to ensure standards like encryption are enforced across all regions and accounts.”
