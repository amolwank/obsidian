## **Interview Short Answer (30 seconds):**

"AWS Session Manager is a secure and fully managed alternative to SSH/RDP that provides browser-based shell access to EC2 instances without needing to open inbound ports, manage SSH keys, or use bastion hosts. It uses IAM for authentication, CloudTrail for auditing, and encrypts all session traffic, making it more secure and compliant than traditional remote access methods."

## **Detailed Technical Explanation:**

### **What is Session Manager?**

Session Manager is a **secure server management solution** that allows you to:

- Start secure shell sessions without SSH keys or bastion hosts
    
- Audit and log all session activity
    
- Restrict access using IAM policies
    
- Access instances in private subnets directly
    

### **Key Benefits:**

## **Architecture & How It Works:**

### **High-Level Flow:**

text

User → AWS Management Console/CLI → Session Manager → SSM Agent → EC2 Instance
         (IAM Auth)                    (Service)        (Running on instance)

### **Components:**

1. **SSM Agent**: Runs on the managed instance
    
2. **Session Manager Service**: AWS-managed service
    
3. **IAM Roles/Policies**: Control access and permissions
    
4. **CloudWatch/CloudTrail**: For logging and monitoring
