MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, and MCP Servers are the servers-side implementations of this protocol. In essence, they can act as smart bridges that connect AI agents (e.g. LLM-powerd applications) to external tools, data sources, and services in a standardized, secure and modular way.

Why They Matter;
Before MCP, every AI-Tool integration was custom- leading to brittle, difficult-to-maintain pipelines. 
MCP Servers solve this by offering:
- Context Management: Handling user and task state centrally rather than embedding it in every prompt.
- Capability Exposure: Advertising what tools/data are available, under the right permissions.
- Secure interactions: Enforcing authorisation and governance rules.
