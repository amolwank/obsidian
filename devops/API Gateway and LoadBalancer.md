## üß© Core Difference (Summary First)

|Feature|**API Gateway**|**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Designed for **API management** (REST, HTTP, WebSocket APIs).|Designed for **load balancing web traffic** to EC2, containers, or on-prem targets.|
|**Typical Use Case**|When you expose **APIs to external clients** or need **authentication, throttling, caching, or versioning**.|When you need to **distribute incoming web/app traffic** across multiple backend servers or containers.|
|**Target**|Integrates with **Lambda, HTTP endpoints, or other AWS services**.|Routes traffic to **EC2, ECS, EKS, or IP targets**.|
|**Protocol Support**|HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket|HTTP, HTTPS|
|**Routing Logic**|Path-based and method-based routing (e.g., `/users`, `GET /orders`)|Path-based and host-based routing (e.g., `/app1`, `/app2`)|
|**Caching**|Built-in API response caching (at API Gateway layer)|No caching (you‚Äôd use CloudFront or app-level cache)|
|**Authentication / Authorization**|Built-in support for IAM, Cognito, JWT authorizers, API keys|No built-in auth ‚Äî must be implemented in backend|
|**Rate Limiting / Throttling**|Built-in|Not supported (needs backend or WAF)|
|**Transformation**|Can transform request/response payloads (mapping templates, JSON ‚Üî XML)|No transformation capabilities|
|**Pricing Model**|Pay per API call (can get expensive for high traffic)|Pay per hour + data processed (cheaper at scale)|

## üèóÔ∏è When to Use **API Gateway**

Use **API Gateway** when:

- You are building **serverless APIs** (Lambda + API Gateway).
    
- You need **fine-grained control** over requests/responses:
    
    - Request validation
        
    - Header manipulation
        
    - JSON transformation
        
- You need **authentication/authorization** at the API level (Cognito, JWT, IAM).
    
- You need **rate limiting**, **usage plans**, or **API keys**.
    
- You want **multi-version API management** and **public developer access**.
    
- You want **built-in caching** of API responses.
    
- You are exposing **external APIs to clients or partners**.
    

üìò **Example:**

> A mobile app calling backend Lambda functions for authentication, profile data, and transactions ‚Äî all managed by API Gateway.

## üß± When to Use **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

Use **ALB** when:

- You have a **web application or microservices** running on **ECS, EC2, or EKS**.
    
- You just need **path-based routing** like `/app1 ‚Üí service1`, `/app2 ‚Üí service2`.
    
- You want to distribute load **within your private network or VPC**.
    
- You already handle **authentication** and **request validation** in your app.
    
- You need **WebSocket** or **gRPC** load balancing (supported in ALB).
    
- You need **sticky sessions** or **WebSocket connections**.
    
- You want to expose a **traditional web app** or internal APIs.
    

üìò **Example:**

> A React frontend on S3/CloudFront calling an internal ALB that routes requests to ECS microservices like `user-service`, `order-service`, etc.

## üí° Quick Differentiation Line for Interview

> ‚ÄúAPI Gateway is for **managing and securing APIs** with built-in features like authentication, throttling, and caching ‚Äî while ALB is for **scaling and distributing web traffic** efficiently to compute resources.  
> Both support routing, but API Gateway provides **API-level governance**, whereas ALB provides **network-level load distribution**.‚Äù

## ‚öñÔ∏è Common Comparison Scenarios

| Scenario                                | Best Choice | Why                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Serverless (Lambda) backend**         | API Gateway | Direct integration with Lambda, supports auth, throttling, caching |
| **Microservices on ECS/EKS**            | ALB         | Native load balancing and routing across containers                |
| **Public APIs with rate limits & auth** | API Gateway | Built-in developer access control                                  |
| **High-traffic web app**                | ALB         | Lower cost and latency, suitable for continuous traffic            |
| **Internal service-to-service calls**   | ALB         | Private VPC routing and scaling                                    |
| **External client-facing API**          | API Gateway | Supports versioning, security, throttling, etc.                    |
