Docker is a platform that allows you to build, run, and manage applications inside containers.
- Container -> A lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, system tools, libraries).
- Docker Engine -> Core software that creates and runs containers.
- Docker Images -> Blueprints for containers (like a recipe)
- Docker Hub -> A registry where you can find and share container images.
