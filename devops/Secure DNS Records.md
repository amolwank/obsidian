### 🔹 **What are DNS Records?**

DNS records are instructions stored in the **Domain Name System (DNS)** that tell the internet how to route traffic for your domain.

They work like a **phonebook for the internet** → mapping **domain names** (like `example.com`) to **IP addresses** or other services.

### 🔹 **Types of DNS Records (Common Ones):**

- **A Record** → Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
    
- **AAAA Record** → Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
    
- **CNAME (Canonical Name)** → Points one domain to another domain (alias).
    
- **MX (Mail Exchange)** → Tells email servers where to deliver emails.
    
- **TXT Record** → Stores text data, often used for verification, SPF, DKIM, DMARC.
    
- **NS (Name Server)** → Points to the DNS servers that host your domain zone.
    
- **SRV** → Defines services like SIP, VoIP, etc.
    
- **CAA** → Specifies which Certificate Authorities can issue SSL/TLS certs for your domain.

### 🔹 **Example**

If you type `www.example.com` in your browser:

1. DNS record **A** says → `www.example.com` = `192.0.2.1`.
    
2. Your computer connects to `192.0.2.1`.
    
3. Website loads.

✅ **Interview One-liner:**  
“DNS records are entries in the Domain Name System that map domain names to IP addresses or other services like mail servers, helping browsers and applications locate resources on the internet.”
### 🔹 **1. Use DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)**

- Protects against **DNS spoofing / cache poisoning**.
    
- Validates that DNS responses are **authentic** and not tampered with.
    

---

### 🔹 **2. Control Access to DNS Management**

- Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** – only authorized admins can update DNS.
- Enable **MFA** (multi-factor authentication) on your DNS provider or Route 53.
    

---

### 🔹 **3. Monitor & Audit Changes**

- Enable logging (e.g., **Route 53 logs, CloudTrail**) to track who changed DNS records.
    
- Set up alerts for unauthorized modifications.
    

---

### 🔹 **4. Restrict Zone Transfers**

- Disable or limit **AXFR zone transfers** to trusted secondary DNS servers only.
    
- Prevents attackers from dumping your full DNS zone file.
    

---

### 🔹 **5. Protect Against DDoS Attacks**

- Use **Anycast-based DNS** providers (like AWS Route 53, Cloudflare, Akamai).
    
- Use **AWS Shield or Cloudflare DDoS protection**.
    

---

### 🔹 **6. Secure Records Themselves**

- Use **least privilege principle** – only create records that are required.
    
- Avoid exposing internal records (like private IPs).
    
- Use **split-horizon DNS** for internal vs external users.
    

---

### 🔹 **7. TLS & Email Security**

- Add **CAA records** → control which Certificate Authorities can issue SSL/TLS certs for your domain.
    
- Add **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** records → prevent email spoofing.

✅ **Interview One-liner:**  
“To secure DNS records, I would enable DNSSEC, use strict access controls with MFA, restrict zone transfers, monitor and log changes, protect against DDoS with services like Route 53 or Cloudflare, and add security records like CAA, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.”
