Great scenario ðŸ‘Œ â€” this is about **keeping your on-prem DB and AWS RDS in sync** when changes happen in the on-prem DB.

There are multiple ways depending on whether you want **one-way replication** (on-prem â†’ AWS) or **bi-directional sync**. Letâ€™s break it down:

---

## 1. **Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**

- **Best fit** for one-way or continuous replication.
- You create:
    - **Source endpoint** â†’ your on-prem DB (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).
    - **Target endpoint** â†’ RDS/Aurora DB.
- DMS supports:
    - **Full load** (migrate entire DB first).
    - **CDC (Change Data Capture)** â†’ stream inserts/updates/deletes continuously.
- You can replicate specific schemas or tables.
- Benefits: minimal downtime, managed service, supports heterogeneous DBs.
ðŸ‘‰ Example:
- On-prem MySQL â†’ RDS MySQL/Postgres.
- Enable **binlog** on source, DMS reads logs and applies changes to RDS.

## 2. **Native Database Replication (DB engine features)**

- Some DB engines support replication directly:
    
    - **MySQL / MariaDB**: set up RDS as a **read replica** of on-prem MySQL.
        
    - **PostgreSQL**: use **logical replication / WAL streaming** to replicate from on-prem to RDS.
        
    - **Oracle**: use **GoldenGate** or Oracle Data Guard (if licensed).
        
    - **SQL Server**: use transactional replication (with RDS SQL Server as subscriber).
        
- Pros: often lower latency than DMS.
    
- Cons: tightly coupled to DB engine, more manual setup.

## 3. **Data Integration / ETL Tools**

- If you donâ€™t need real-time sync, you can use **batch sync**:
    
    - **AWS Glue** ETL jobs, or tools like Talend, Pentaho (youâ€™ve used before ðŸ˜‰), or Apache NiFi.
        
    - Run jobs on schedule (e.g., hourly, nightly) to copy deltas from on-prem â†’ RDS.
        
- Pros: cheaper than continuous replication, good for analytics workloads.
    
- Cons: not real-time.

## 4. **Event-driven / Streaming approach**

- If your on-prem DB can publish **CDC events** (via Debezium, Kafka, Oracle GoldenGate, SQL Server CDC):
    
    - Stream changes into **Kafka / MSK / Kinesis Data Streams**.
        
    - Consumers apply them to RDS (using Lambda or Kinesis Data Firehose).
        
- Pros: scalable, good for microservices architectures.
    
- Cons: more complex setup.
    

---

## 5. **Bi-directional sync?**

- Trickier (risk of conflicts). Needs conflict resolution rules.
    
- Can be done with:
    
    - DMS with two tasks (each direction).
        
    - Third-party tools (e.g., Qlik Replicate, Striim, Attunity).
        
    - DB-native (Oracle GoldenGate, MySQL group replication).
        

---

âœ… **Best practical solution (recommended)**:

- Use **AWS DMS** for continuous replication from on-prem DB â†’ AWS RDS.
    
- If you need _near real-time & production-grade sync_, prefer **native DB replication** (if supported by your DB engine).
    
- For analytics-only, use **batch ETL with Glue / Pentaho**.
