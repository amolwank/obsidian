### üß† **One-line Summary (for interviews)**

> ‚ÄúThe most widely used AWS security services include IAM for access control, KMS for encryption, GuardDuty and CloudTrail for threat detection and logging, WAF and Shield for application protection, and Security Hub for centralized compliance monitoring.‚Äù

## üõ°Ô∏è **1. AWS GuardDuty ‚Äî Threat Detection & Monitoring**

**Purpose:**  
GuardDuty is a **threat detection service** that continuously monitors AWS accounts, workloads, and data for **malicious activity or unauthorized behavior**.

**How it works:**

- Uses **machine learning**, **anomaly detection**, and **threat intelligence feeds** (from AWS and third parties).
    
- Monitors logs from:
    
    - **VPC Flow Logs** (network traffic)
        
    - **CloudTrail Logs** (API activity)
        
    - **DNS Logs** (suspicious domains)
        
- Detects issues like:
    
    - Compromised IAM credentials
        
    - Crypto-mining activity
        
    - Unusual data access or API calls
        
    - Attacks from known malicious IPs
        

**Example:**  
If GuardDuty sees an IAM user making API calls from an unusual country or IP address, it raises a **finding** (alert).

**Integration:**  
Findings can be sent to **Security Hub**, **SNS**, or **Lambda** for automated responses (e.g., disabling the user or isolating a resource).

---

## üîç **2. AWS Inspector ‚Äî Vulnerability Management**

**Purpose:**  
Inspector is an **automated vulnerability scanning service** for your **EC2 instances**, **ECR container images**, and **Lambda functions**.

**How it works:**

- Continuously scans your workloads for:
    
    - OS-level vulnerabilities (CVEs)
        
    - Application package vulnerabilities
        
    - Misconfigurations that violate best practices
        
- Uses AWS Systems Manager (SSM) agents to collect metadata from EC2.
    
- Assigns **CVSS-based severity scores** (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
    

**Example:**  
If an EC2 instance is running a version of Apache with a known vulnerability (CVE), Inspector will flag it and suggest remediation steps.

**Integration:**  
Findings appear in the **AWS Inspector dashboard** and can be aggregated in **AWS Security Hub**.

## üîí **3. AWS Macie ‚Äî Data Privacy & Protection**

**Purpose:**  
Macie is a **data security and privacy service** that uses **machine learning** to automatically discover, classify, and protect **sensitive data in Amazon S3**.

**How it works:**

- Scans S3 buckets for sensitive information like:
    
    - PII (Personally Identifiable Information) ‚Äî e.g., names, emails, phone numbers
        
    - Financial data ‚Äî e.g., credit card numbers
        
    - Credentials or access keys
        
- Provides dashboards showing which buckets contain sensitive or publicly accessible data.
    

**Example:**  
If Macie finds a CSV file in S3 containing customer SSNs or credit card numbers, it flags it as a **sensitive data exposure** risk.

**Integration:**  
Alerts can go to **Security Hub**, **CloudWatch**, or **EventBridge** for automated remediation (e.g., making the bucket private).
