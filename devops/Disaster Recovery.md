Disaster Recovery (DR) is a set of plans, processes, and tools that help an organization quickly restore its IT systems, data and applications after a major disruption.

In simple works:
Its a backup plan for emergencies so that your business can continue running even it something goes wrong.

Core Concepts:
1. RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
	1. How quickly systems must be restored.
	2. Example: We must bring the website back online within 2 hours.
2. RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
	1. How much data loss is acceptable (measured in time).
	2. Example: "We can afford to lose only the last 15 minutes of data."

Excellent — saying you’ve **designed a Pilot Light Disaster Recovery (DR)** setup is a strong point for cloud architect interviews 👏

To present it effectively, you should:

1. Explain **why** you chose the _pilot light_ strategy,
    
2. Describe **how** you implemented it (key AWS services used), and
    
3. Highlight **outcomes** — cost efficiency, RTO/RPO, etc.
    

Here’s how you can structure and say it professionally 👇

### **✅ Short Resume/Project Summary Version**

> Designed and implemented a **Pilot Light Disaster Recovery (DR) architecture** on AWS to ensure business continuity for critical applications. The setup replicated essential infrastructure components, databases, and configurations in a secondary region using **Amazon RDS cross-region replication**, **Amazon S3 cross-region replication**, and **AWS CloudFormation** for environment provisioning. During normal operations, only core services ran in the DR region to minimize cost, while in a disaster scenario, the environment could be scaled up automatically using **Auto Scaling** and **Elastic Load Balancing**. This approach provided a cost-efficient DR solution with an **RTO under 2 hours** and **RPO under 15 minutes**.

### **✅ Interview Explanation (How to Speak About It)**

> “In one of my previous projects, I designed a **Pilot Light DR architecture** to maintain business continuity without incurring the cost of a fully active-active setup.
> 
> We identified the **critical components** — mainly the Aurora MySQL database and key application configurations — that needed to stay active in the DR region. Using **cross-region replication for Aurora** and **S3 replication**, we kept a continuously updated copy of the data.
> 
> The rest of the infrastructure (like EC2 instances, load balancers, and app servers) was defined using **CloudFormation templates**, so during a disaster we could quickly spin them up and restore full operations.
> 
> This setup achieved an **RTO of around 1–2 hours** and **RPO of about 15 minutes**, giving us a cost-effective yet reliable DR strategy.”

### **✅ Key AWS Services to Mention**

- **Amazon Aurora / RDS cross-region replication** – for database DR
    
- **Amazon S3 cross-region replication (CRR)** – for object data backup
    
- **CloudFormation or Terraform** – to quickly provision infrastructure in DR region
    
- **Route 53 failover routing policy** – to redirect traffic automatically
    
- **CloudWatch + SNS** – for alerting and failover triggers
    
- **EC2 Auto Scaling** – for scaling up resources in DR scenario
