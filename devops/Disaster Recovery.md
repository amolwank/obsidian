Its a backup plan for emergencies so that your business can continue running even it something goes wrong.

Core Concepts:
1. RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
	1. How quickly systems must be restored.
	2. Example: We must bring the website back online within 2 hours.
2. RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
	1. How much data loss is acceptable (measured in time).
	2. Example: "We can afford to lose only the last 15 minutes of data."
