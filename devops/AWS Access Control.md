### Summary for an Interview

**"AWS Access Control is a multi-layered security model. The four primary types are:**

1. **IAM:** For identity-centric control over AWS service APIs.
2. **Resource-Based Policies (like S3 Bucket Policies):** For granting cross-account access directly to a resource.
3. **Network Controls (Security Groups & NACLs):** For controlling traffic at the network level.
4. **Organizations SCPs:** For establishing central guardrails and permission boundaries across multiple AWS accounts."

This layered approach ensures you can enforce security at the identity, resource, network, and organizational levels.
