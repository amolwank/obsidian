### üîπ **What is an Ingress?**

In Kubernetes, an **Ingress** is an API object that manages **external access to services** in a cluster, typically via HTTP/HTTPS.

It acts like a **smart router** that directs incoming traffic to the right service based on rules.

---

### üîπ **Why We Need Ingress:**

1. **Single Entry Point**
    
    - Provides a unified endpoint for multiple services instead of exposing each service via a separate LoadBalancer.
        
2. **Path-Based or Host-Based Routing**
    
    - Route traffic based on URL paths (e.g., `/app1` ‚Üí Service1, `/app2` ‚Üí Service2).
        
    - Route traffic based on hostnames (e.g., `app1.example.com` ‚Üí Service1).
        
3. **TLS/HTTPS Termination**
    
    - Ingress can manage SSL/TLS certificates, enabling HTTPS access to services.
        
4. **Load Balancing**
    
    - Distributes traffic across multiple pods for high availability.
        
5. **Cost-Effective**
    
    - Avoids creating multiple cloud LoadBalancers for each service.
        
6. **Advanced Features**
    
    - Can integrate with **WAF**, authentication, rate limiting, and more depending on the Ingress Controller.

### üîπ **Use Case Example:**

- A Kubernetes cluster hosts multiple microservices.
    
- Instead of creating a LoadBalancer per service, an Ingress object with rules can route all traffic from `example.com` to the correct service based on path or host.

‚úÖ **Interview One-liner:**  
‚ÄúIngress in Kubernetes provides a single, centralized entry point for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, enabling routing, load balancing, TLS termination, and cost-efficient access to multiple services in the cluster.‚Äù

Why we need Ingress?
Normally, you can expose apps in Kubernetes using:
- ClusterIP -> only inside cluster
- NodePort -> accessible on <NodeIP:PORT>
- LoadBalancer -> creates a cloud load balancer (one per service constly)

Ingress solves this by providing a single entry point that routes requests to different services based on rules.

How it works?
1. Ingress Controller:
	- A pod that actually processes ingress rules(e.g. IGINX Ingress Controller, HAProxy).
	- Without an Ingress Controller, the Ingress object won't work.
2. Ingress Resource (YAML)
	- Defines the routing rules for traffic.
Example:
Suppose you have two services inside your cluster
- service1 -> frontend app
- service2 -> backend app
You want :
- http://my.app.com/frontend -> go to service1
- http://myapp.com/backend -> go to service2
You write an Ingress resource like this:
```
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
	name:
	annotations:
		nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target:/
spec:
	rules:
	- host: myapp.com
	  http:
	   paths:
	   - path: /frontend
	     pathType: Prefix
	     backend:
	       service:
	         name: service1
	         port:
	           number: 80
	   - path: /backend
	     pathType: Prefix
	     backend:
	       service:
	         name: service2
	         port:
	           number: 80             
		
	
```

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: foo-service
            port:
              number: 3000
      - path: /bar
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: bar-service
            port:
              number: 6000
  - host: foo.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/foo"
        backend:
          service:
            name: foo-service-2
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: "*.foo.example.com"
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/foo"
        backend:
          service:
            name: foo-service-3
            port:
              number: 8080
```

Benefits of Ingress
- Single external IP for multiple services
- Flexible routing (based on path, subdomain, headers,etc.)
- Can terminate SSL/TLS at the Ingress Controller
- Cheaper that creating multiple Loadbalancer.

### ‚ö° **30-sec Answer (Quick & Crisp)**

‚ÄúIngress in Kubernetes provides a single entry point for external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to access services in a cluster. It allows path- or host-based routing, TLS termination, and load balancing without exposing each service individually.‚Äù

---

### ‚ö° **60-sec Answer (Slightly Detailed)**

‚ÄúKubernetes Ingress is used to manage external access to services in a cluster via HTTP/HTTPS. It acts as a smart router, directing traffic based on hostnames or URL paths, enabling TLS/HTTPS termination and load balancing. Using Ingress reduces the need to create separate LoadBalancers for each service, making it cost-effective and easier to manage multiple services behind a single endpoint.‚Äù

---

### ‚ö° **Detailed Answer (2‚Äì3 min)**

‚ÄúIngress in Kubernetes is an API object that defines rules for routing external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services inside the cluster. Instead of exposing each service via a LoadBalancer or NodePort, Ingress provides a centralized entry point.

Key features include:

- **Path-based routing:** Route `/app1` traffic to Service1, `/app2` to Service2.
    
- **Host-based routing:** Route `app1.example.com` to Service1, `app2.example.com` to Service2.
    
- **TLS/HTTPS termination:** Manage SSL/TLS certificates at the Ingress level.
    
- **Load balancing:** Distribute requests across multiple pods for high availability.
    

Ingress works with **Ingress Controllers** like Nginx, AWS ALB Ingress, or Traefik to implement these rules. It is cost-efficient, simplifies traffic management, and enables additional features like authentication, WAF integration, and rate limiting. In short, Ingress provides secure, flexible, and centralized access for multiple services in a Kubernetes cluster.‚Äù

### üîπ **Why we need Ingress if we already have Services?**

1. **Service Types are Limited**
    

- **ClusterIP** ‚Üí Internal only, not accessible outside the cluster.
    
- **NodePort** ‚Üí Exposes service on each node‚Äôs port (manual and hard to scale).
    
- **LoadBalancer** ‚Üí Creates a cloud LB per service ‚Üí can be **expensive** if you have many services.
    

2. **Ingress Provides a Single Entry Point**
    

- With many services, you don‚Äôt want **one LoadBalancer per service**.
    
- Ingress acts as a **smart router** that directs traffic to multiple services via **host/path rules**.
    

3. **Advanced Routing & Security**
    

- Path-based routing (`/app1` ‚Üí Service1, `/app2` ‚Üí Service2).
    
- Host-based routing (`app1.example.com` ‚Üí Service1).
    
- TLS/HTTPS termination at one place (no need per service).
    
- Can integrate with authentication, WAF, and rate limiting.
    

4. **Cost & Management Efficiency**
    

- Reduces cloud costs (fewer LoadBalancers).
    
- Centralizes management of external access.

### üîπ **Analogy:**

- **Service** ‚Üí Each service is like a door directly to a room in a building.
    
- **Ingress** ‚Üí A receptionist at the main entrance directs visitors to the right room based on the name or purpose.
    
- Saves building from having **one separate main door per room**.

‚úÖ **Interview One-liner:**  
‚ÄúWhile Services expose pods, Ingress provides a single, centralized entry point with host/path routing, TLS termination, and advanced security, reducing the need for multiple LoadBalancers and simplifying external access management.‚Äù
