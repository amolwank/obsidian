## ðŸ”¹ How to Manage Secrets Securely in Terraform

### 1. **Do NOT hardcode secrets**

- Never put passwords, API keys, or tokens directly in `.tf` files or `terraform.tfvars`.
- This avoids exposure in Git history or Terraform state in plain text.
    

---

### 2. **Use Secret Managers**

- **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store** (with `SecureString`).
```
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id = "prod/db/password"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  username = "admin"
  password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string
}
```


### 3. Use Environment Variables + CI/CD

    - Inject secrets at runtime in GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Terraform Cloud.

```
export TF_VAR_db_password=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "prod/db/password" --with-decryption --query "Parameter.Value" --output text)
```

- Terraform picks it up via variable definition.

### 4. **Encrypt State**

- Store remote state in **S3 with SSE-KMS encryption**.
    
- Enable **DynamoDB state locking** to avoid exposure during concurrent runs.
    

---

### 5. **Limit Access**

- Use **IAM roles with least privilege** for Terraform execution.
- Restrict access to secrets and KMS keys only to CI/CD roles, not all developers.
    

---

### 6. **Optional: Vault Integration**

- HashiCorp Vault can also be used for dynamic secrets (e.g., DB credentials that rotate automatically).

_"We never hardcode secrets in Terraform code. Instead, we fetch them securely from AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store, and inject them into resources at runtime. Secrets are passed as environment variables in CI/CD pipelines, never stored in Git. Our Terraform state is stored remotely in encrypted S3 with KMS and locked via DynamoDB. We enforce IAM least privilege so only Terraform execution roles can access secrets. This way, sensitive data stays secure, auditable, and outside of code."_
