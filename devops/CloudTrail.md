AWS CloudTrail is a **logging and auditing** service in AWS.
It records all API calls and actions made in your AWS account, whether done through:
- AWS Management Console
- AWS CLI
- SDKs, or
- AWS Services themselves.
Key Points:
- Tracks "who did what, when, and from where"
- Logs include API calls, source IP, user identity, time, and affected resources.
- Store logs in Amazon S3 (and can integrate with CloudWatch Logs for monitoring).
- Helps in security analysis, troubleshooting, auditing, and compliance.
