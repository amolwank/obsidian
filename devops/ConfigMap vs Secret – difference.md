### ‚è±Ô∏è **60-sec Answer (Crisp)**

- **ConfigMap** stores **non-sensitive configuration data** (like environment variables, file paths).
    
- **Secret** stores **sensitive data** (like passwords, API keys, certificates) and is **Base64 encoded** by default.
    
- Secrets have **stricter access control** (via RBAC) and can be integrated with external secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
    
- Use ConfigMap for general configs, Secrets for credentials.

In Kubernetes:

- **ConfigMap** is used to store configuration data that applications need but which is **not sensitive**. Example: app configs, log levels, or feature flags. It helps decouple config from code so you can change behavior without rebuilding the image.
    
- **Secret** is designed to store **confidential data** like database credentials, TLS certificates, or tokens. It‚Äôs stored in **Base64-encoded form** in etcd, and Kubernetes allows enabling encryption at rest and restricting access via RBAC.
    
- Unlike ConfigMaps, Secrets support **integration with external secret managers** (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, SSM) and have stricter handling by the API server.
    
- Best practice:
    
    - Use **ConfigMap** for configs you might share openly with the team.
        
    - Use **Secrets** for sensitive values, never commit them to Git.
        
    - For production, prefer external secret management solutions with Kubernetes integrations.
        

üëâ In short: **ConfigMap = non-sensitive configs, Secret = sensitive data, with security controls.**
