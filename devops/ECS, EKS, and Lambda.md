## 🔹 **30-sec Answer (Crisp)**

- **Lambda** → Best for **event-driven, short-lived tasks** with no server management.
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** → Managed container orchestration, simple to use, integrates deeply with AWS. Great for **microservices and batch jobs**.
    
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** → Managed Kubernetes, chosen when you need **multi-cloud portability or complex orchestration**.
    

👉 Rule of thumb:

- Small, event-based → **Lambda**
    
- Containers, AWS-only → **ECS**
    
- Containers, multi-cloud/complex → **EKS**

## 🔹 **1-min Answer (Concise with use cases)**

- **Lambda**: Serverless, pay-per-use, automatically scales. Best for lightweight APIs, cron jobs, file processing. Not ideal for **long-running or stateful apps**.
    
- **ECS**: AWS-managed container orchestration. Runs on **EC2 or Fargate**. Easier to operate than Kubernetes. Great for **microservices** in an AWS-centric environment.
    
- **EKS**: Fully managed Kubernetes. Gives you **control + flexibility** (custom networking, operators, service mesh). Best for **multi-cloud, hybrid, or large-scale enterprise** workloads where teams already use Kubernetes.

## 🔹 **2–3 min Answer (Senior-level depth)**

1. **Lambda**
    - Event-driven, scales instantly.
    - Cost-efficient (pay per request + execution time).
    - Best for **serverless APIs, automation, data pipelines**.
    - **Limitations**: Cold starts, 15-min execution max, limited runtime customization.
        
2. **ECS**
    - AWS-native container platform, simpler than Kubernetes.
    - Works with **Fargate** (serverless containers) or **EC2** (self-managed).
    - Deep AWS integration (CloudWatch, IAM, ALB).
    - Great for **teams that don’t want Kubernetes complexity**.
3. **EKS**
    - Managed Kubernetes control plane.
    - Gives flexibility: **custom networking, service mesh (Istio), GitOps (ArgoCD)**.
    - Ideal for enterprises standardizing on **Kubernetes across AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-prem**.
    - More complex to operate, but powerful for large orgs.

✅ **Interview Tip**: Always end with **a scenario-based recommendation**:

> “If I’m building a small event-driven system like image processing, I’d use **Lambda**.  
> For AWS-focused microservices, I’d recommend **ECS** for simplicity.  
> For enterprises that need portability and advanced orchestration, I’d go with **EKS**.”
