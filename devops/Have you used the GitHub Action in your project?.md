*"Yes, I have implemented GitHub Actions in my projects to automate end-to-end CI/CD pipelines for both infrastructure and application deployments.

For **infrastructure**, I set up a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow triggered on `push` or `pull_request` to the main branch. The workflow included steps to check out the code, configure AWS credentials securely using GitHub Secrets, and run Terraform commands: `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`. We used a **remote S3 backend with native state locking** to ensure consistency across environments, and separate workspaces for **dev, staging, and production**. I also included **linting and unit tests** for Terraform modules to catch errors early.

For the **application layer**, another workflow built, tested, and packaged Docker images on every push. Images were pushed to **Amazon ECR** following a structured tagging strategy (`branch-name` or `version` tags). Deployment to Kubernetes was automated using **kubectl and Helm charts**. We maintained separate namespaces for dev/staging/prod clusters and implemented **blue/green deployments** for minimal downtime. Rollbacks could be triggered automatically if Helm detected deployment failures.

To optimize efficiency, the workflows leveraged **parallel jobs**, **caching of dependencies**, and secure management of secrets. Logs and failure notifications were configured via GitHub Actions and integrated with **Slack**, ensuring rapid feedback.

Overall, this CI/CD setup allowed fully automated infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, improved consistency across environments, reduced manual errors, and scaled seamlessly with traffic. We kept costs minimal by using **serverless runners, caching Docker layers, and pay-per-use AWS services**."*
