## ðŸ”¹ How Terraform Manages AWS + Azure Together

### 1. **Providers for Each Cloud**

Terraform supports **multiple providers** in the same configuration.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

```


### 2. Separate State Files (Best Practice)

    Use different state backends for AWS and Azure to avoid conflicts.

    Example:

        aws/terraform.tfstate â†’ stored in S3 + DynamoDB

        azure/terraform.tfstate â†’ stored in Azure Storage + Blob lock

### 3. Organize Codebase

Repo structure example:

```
terraform/
â”œâ”€â”€ aws/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vpc/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ azure/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vnet/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tf
â””â”€â”€ shared/
    â””â”€â”€ modules/
```
- Each cloud uses its own modules.
    
- Shared logic (like tagging, naming conventions) can go in common modules.
    

---

### 4. **Cross-Cloud Integration**

- Terraform can **output values from one provider** and use them in another.  
    Example: use AWS S3 bucket as a backup target for Azure resources:

```
output "s3_bucket_arn" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.backup.arn
}

module "azure_backup" {
  source      = "../azure/backup"
  storage_arn = module.aws_s3.s3_bucket_arn
}
```

### 5. Workspaces / Environments

    Use workspaces (dev/staging/prod) across both clouds.

    Or use Terragrunt to keep config DRY across AWS + Azure.

### 6. CI/CD Integration

    GitHub Actions / Jenkins runs Terraform jobs for AWS and Azure separately.

    Example:

        Job 1 â†’ terraform plan/apply for AWS

        Job 2 â†’ terraform plan/apply for Azure

### 7. Governance & Security

    Store secrets in respective secret managers:

        AWS Secrets Manager / SSM Parameter Store

        Azure Key Vault

    Enforce least privilege IAM/Azure AD roles.

### ðŸ”¹ Interview-Ready Answer (45 sec)

"Terraform is provider-agnostic, so I can manage AWS and Azure resources in the same repo by declaring multiple providers. I keep separate state files for each cloud â€” S3 with DynamoDB for AWS and Azure Blob for Azure. The repo is organized with separate folders for AWS and Azure, and I use modules for reusability. CI/CD pipelines run plans and applies per provider, and if cross-cloud integration is needed, I pass outputs between providers. Secrets are handled via AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault. This gives us consistency, security, and a single workflow to manage multi-cloud infrastructure."
