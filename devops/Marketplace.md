The GitHub Actions Marketplace is like an app store for automation workflows. It's a place where you can find, share, and use pre-build Actions created by GitHub or the Community.

**What it is:**
- A Public library of reusable Actions that you can plug into your workflows.
- Each Action is a small piece of automation.(e.g. Deploy to AWS, run tests, Send slack Notifications )
- Save time because you don't need to write everything from scratch.
