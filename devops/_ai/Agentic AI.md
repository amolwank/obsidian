Agentic AI - AI systems that can act as agents.
Instead of just answering questions (like traditional chatbots), they take initiative:
- Plan task
- Break them into steps
- Use tools (APIs, software, databases)
- Execute actions automatically
In short : Agentic AI = AI that doesn't just think, but also does things on its own.

Real-World Examples:
- AI Assistants that schedule meetings, send emails, or update CRM systems.
- DevOps agents that detect server issues and automatically restart services.
- Financial AI agents that monitor markets and place trades.
- Customer support agents that not only chat, but also create tickets, reset passwords or process refunds.
