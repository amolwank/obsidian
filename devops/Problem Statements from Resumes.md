##### Cloud-Native Data Lake Implementation (AWS S3 + Athena + Glue)
- **Problem:**  
    Our organization was dealing with large volumes of structured data from multiple sources. Traditional ETL pipelines and reporting systems were slow, batch-oriented, and required heavy infrastructure. This caused long reporting times and prevented stakeholders from getting real-time insights for decision-making.   
- **Solution:**  
    I designed and implemented a **cloud-native data lake** using **AWS S3** for centralized storage, **AWS Glue** for schema discovery and ETL, and **Amazon Athena** for serverless querying. This serverless architecture eliminated the need for managing infrastructure, provided on-demand querying, and allowed near real-time analytics at scale.
- **Impact:**  
    This solution reduced reporting time by **70%**, enabled **ad-hoc and near real-time analytics**, and gave business stakeholders faster, data-driven decision-making capabilitiesâ€”all while lowering operational costs compared to traditional systems.

##### Microservices Architecture Migration (Kubernetes + Terraform + AWS)
- **Problem:**  
    The legacy Java monolith was difficult to scale, had long release cycles, and frequent downtime during deployments. It lacked flexibility to adopt new features quickly and created bottlenecks for both developers and operations teams.
- **Solution:**  
    I migrated the application to a **microservices architecture** running on **Kubernetes**, using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (repeatable and consistent cluster provisioning). I implemented **CI/CD automation** to streamline builds, containerization, deployments, and rolling updates.
- **Impact:**  
    Achieved **99.9% availability**, significantly improved deployment efficiency, enabled independent scaling of services, and reduced downtime during releases. This migration gave teams faster delivery cycles and more agility to innovate.
###### **Detailed Version (2 min)**

*"The main challenge was a legacy Java monolith that made scaling and releasing new features slow and error-prone. Every deployment involved downtime, and the lack of modularity created bottlenecks for teams.

To solve this, I led the migration to a **microservices architecture** deployed on **Kubernetes**. Using **Terraform**, I provisioned the infrastructure as code to ensure consistency and repeatability across environments. Each microservice was containerized, and we implemented CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions to automate builds, testing, container pushes, and rolling deployments into Kubernetes.

This setup not only improved deployment speed but also enabled zero-downtime rollouts and independent scaling of services. As a result, we achieved **99.9% application availability**, reduced downtime during deployments to almost zero, and significantly improved developer productivity and delivery timelines."*
