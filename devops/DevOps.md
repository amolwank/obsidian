DevOps is a culture, mindset, and set of practices that bring development (Dev) and Operations(Ops) teams together to deliver software faster, more reliable, and with better quality.

Its not just tools- its about collaborations + automation + continuous improvement.
#### **Common Terminology in DevOps:**

**Shift Left :**

**Shift Left** is a principle in software development and DevOps that focuses on **moving activities earlier in the lifecycle**â€”or "shifting" them to the "left" of the project timeline.

The core idea is to introduce practices like testing, quality assurance, and security checks at the initial stages of development rather than waiting until the end (the "right" side of the timeline, typically the deployment or final QA phase).

###### **Common DevOps Tool**

3. Infrastructure as Code -> Terraform , [[Ansible]], AWS CloudFormation
4. Monitoring -> [[Prometheus]], [[Grafana]], [[ELK Stack]]
5. Version Control -> [[Git]]
