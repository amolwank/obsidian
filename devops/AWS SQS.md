- Amazon SQS = Fully managed messaged queue service.
- It help you decouple and scale microservice, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
- Instead of services talking to each other directly, they send message via a queue.

Think of it a post office for your app - one service sends a message, another picks it up when ready.
