It's the central place in the AWS console where you can:
- View and pay your bills
- Track AWS service usage
- Control and optimize consts
- Manage budgets and credits
Basically, it's your finance dashboard for AWS.

In Short: AWS Billing and Cost Management = your control center for AWS spending, billing, and cost optimization
