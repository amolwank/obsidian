Introduction:
AWS(Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.
It offers on-demands services like computing power, storage, networking, databases analytics, machine learning, and more - all delivered over the network.

[[AWS Security Services]]:
###### Key Points:
- Launched: 2006 by Amazon.
- Pay-as-you-go model: You pay only for what you use.
- Global Infrastructure: AWS has data centers worldwide (called Regions and Availability Zones)
- Scalability: can scale up or down resources quickly based on demand.
- Security:Provide identity management, encryption, compliance certificates.

[[API Gateway and LoadBalancer]]
###### Major AWS Services:
- Compute
	- [[EC2]] (Elastic Compute Cloud) -> Virtual Server
	- [[Lambda]] -> Serverless computing (run code without managing servers)
	- [[ECS]]/[[EKS]] -> Container services
- Storage:
	- [[S3]] (Simple Storage Service) ->Object storage
	- [[EBS]] (Elastic Block Store) -> Disk storage for EC2
	- [[Glacier]] ->Archival storage
- Databases:
	- [[RDS]] (Relational Database Service).
	- [[DynamoDB]] (NoSQL database).
	- [[Redshift]] (Data warehouse).
- Networking and Security:
	- [[VPC]] (Virtual Private Cloud)
	- [[Route 53]] (DNS)
	- [[IAM]] (Identity and Access Management).
- Monitoring and Tools:
	- [[CloudWatch]] (Monitoring).
	- [[CloudTrail]] (Audit logs).
	- [[CloudFormation]] / Terraform (Infrastructure as code) 

Main Services:
[[AWS Route53]]
[[AWS GuardDuty]]
[[AWS Control Tower]]
[[AWS Global Accelerator]]
###### [[Cloud Security in AWS]]:
AWS follows the shared Responsibility Model:
- AWS secures the infrastructure (data centers, hardware, networking)
- You (the customer) secure what you run on top of AWS (Apps, data, IAM, configs)
[[Cost Optimization]]
[[AWS Step Functions]]
[[AWS Organizations]] -> is a service that lets you centrally manage multiple AWS accounts. 
[[API Gateway ]]-> API Gateway is a service that acts as a single entry point for multiple backend services or APIs
