Nice — here’s a practical, production-ready design for a **3-tier application on AWS** (Web / App / DB) that covers **networking, security, and IAM**. I’ll show the architecture, key components, security controls, IAM patterns, automation & monitoring, and a short checklist you can apply immediately.

# 1) High-level architecture (text diagram)
```
 Internet
   ↓ (HTTPS)
  ALB (public subnets, across AZs)
   ↓
App tier (private subnets, Auto Scaling groups / ECS Fargate / EKS nodes)
   ↓
DB tier (private isolated subnets) — RDS/Aurora (Multi-AZ)
```

Place the ALB in **public subnets** (with an Internet Gateway). App and DB instances live in **private subnets**. App nodes use a NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints for outbound access to the internet/S3 as required. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-example-private-subnets-nat.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 2) Networking details

- VPC spanning 2+ AZs for high availability. Create at least: public subnets (ALB), private app subnets, private DB subnets (isolated, no IGW). [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Route tables: public route table → IGW; private app subnets → NAT Gateway for outbound; DB subnets → no route to IGW (fully isolated). [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-scenarios.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Use **VPC endpoints** (Gateway for S3, Interface endpoints for other AWS APIs) to avoid egress through internet when possible. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-example-private-subnets-nat.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- VPC Flow Logs → CloudWatch / S3 for network visibility and forensic analysis. (Best practice) [Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/security-at-multiple-layers-for-web-administered-apps/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

# 3) Security controls (network + host + perimeter)

- **Security Groups (SGs)**:
    
    - ALB SG: allow inbound 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 (or narrower), outbound to App SG.
        
    - App SG: allow inbound only from ALB SG on app port (e.g., 8080), outbound to DB SG on DB port (e.g., 5432).
        
    - DB SG: allow inbound only from App SG; no public inbound.
        
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)** as a second layer (stateless), keep defaults permissive unless you need explicit subnet-level controls.
    
- **Web protection**: AWS WAF in front of ALB; AWS Shield (standard) enabled automatically — use Shield Advanced when under higher DDoS risk. [Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/security-at-multiple-layers-for-web-administered-apps/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Bastion access / admin**: prefer **AWS Systems Manager Session Manager** instead of opening SSH to the internet — reduces attack surface and uses IAM for access control and audit logging. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/access-a-bastion-host-by-using-session-manager-and-amazon-ec2-instance-connect.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Encryption**: TLS (ACM) for ALB certificates (HTTPS). KMS customer-managed keys for data-at-rest (RDS, S3, EBS). Protect secrets with **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store (SecureString)**. [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.pillar.security.en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

# 4) IAM & identity (principles + concrete patterns)

- **Principles**: strong identity foundation + least privilege + temporary credentials + MFA for human users. Enforce separation of duties. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Workloads**: assign **IAM roles** (not long-term keys) to compute (EC2 instance profiles, ECS task roles, or EKS IRSA service accounts) so apps get **temporary STS credentials**. Use service-specific roles for least privilege. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Human access**: federate to an IdP (SAML/OIDC) where possible (Okta, Azure AD) — avoid permanent IAM users; require MFA. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Tools**: use IAM Access Analyzer, IAM Access Advisor, and Access Analyzer policy generation to tighten permissions and detect external sharing. Automate periodic review of unused credentials. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

### Example minimal IAM policy (app needs read from a specific S3 bucket)
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}

```

Attach this to an IAM role for the app (ECS task role / instance profile) — not to users.

# 5) Observability, auditing, and automation

- **Logging & audit**: CloudTrail (management events), VPC Flow Logs, ALB access logs, RDS logs → centralized S3/CloudWatch. Send security findings to **Security Hub** and enable **GuardDuty** for threat detection. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/operational-best-practices-for-wa-Security-Pillar.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Configuration enforcement**: AWS Config rules (Well-Architected security mappings) to detect drift and misconfigurations. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/operational-best-practices-for-wa-Security-Pillar.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **CI/CD & IaC**: Deploy infra via CloudFormation / Terraform and app via CodePipeline / GitHub Actions. Store secrets in Secrets Manager and rotate automatically. Automate policy checks (IAM, linting) in pipeline. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/terraform-aws-provider-best-practices/security.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

# 6) Resilience & availability

- Multi-AZ for ALB, app ASG, and RDS (Multi-AZ or Aurora Global/Read Replicas depending on RTO/RPO). Use health checks on ALB and readiness/liveness probes for containerized apps. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-example-private-subnets-nat.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

# 7) Extra security-hardening recommendations

- Enforce **least privilege** everywhere; use IAM Access Analyzer and automated policy generation to shrink permissions. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Use **Session Manager** for admin sessions (no open inbound SSH). [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/access-a-bastion-host-by-using-session-manager-and-amazon-ec2-instance-connect.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Protect data in transit and at rest (ACM + KMS). [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.pillar.security.en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Continuously map your architecture against the **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar** and remediate identified issues. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
