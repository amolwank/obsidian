- AWS Cost Explorer is a free visualization tool in [[AWS Billing & Cost Management]].
- It help you see, analyze, and understand how much you're spending on AWS.
- Think of it like an analytics dashboard for your AWS bills.

Cost:
- Free for last 12 months of data (basic reports)
- Detailed hourly/daily granularity beyond 12 months may have a small cost (usually cents per query)
- Forecasting and Saving Plan reports are free.
In short:
- Cost Explorer = microscope (detailed reports and trends).
- Cost Anomaly Detection = watchdog (alerts on unusual spend)
