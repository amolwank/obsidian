## **ASN (Autonomous System Number) - Short Answer**

**ASN** is a **unique identifier** for a network or group of IP networks under single technical management.

---

### **Key Points:**

**What it is:**

- **Globally unique number** assigned to networks
    
- Represents a **routing domain** with unified routing policy
    
- Essential for **BGP routing** between networks
    

**Types:**

- **Public ASN**: For Internet routing (1-64511)
    
- **Private ASN**: For internal use (64512-65534)
    
- **32-bit ASN**: Extended range for growth (4-byte ASNs)
    

**How it works:**

- Each ASN has its own **routing policies**
    
- **BGP** uses ASNs to make routing decisions
    
- **AS Path** shows route traversal through networks
    

**Examples:**

- **Google**: AS15169
    
- **AWS**: AS16509
    
- **Cloudflare**: AS13335
    
- **Your ISP**: Has its own ASN
    

**Why it matters:**

- Enables **Internet scalability** - 75,000+ networks can interoperate
    
- Allows **traffic engineering** and policy-based routing
    
- Essential for **BGP peering** and **anycast** deployments
    

**Real-world analogy:** ASN is like a **business license number** for networks - it identifies who operates the network and enables legal "business" (routing) with other networks.
