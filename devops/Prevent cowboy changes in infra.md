## ðŸ”¹ How to Prevent Direct `terraform apply` from Laptops

### 1. **Centralize Execution**

- Only allow **CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)** to run `terraform apply`.
- Developers can run `terraform plan` locally, but not apply.
    

---

### 2. **IAM Permissions**

- Developers get **read-only or plan-only IAM roles**.    
- Only CI/CD runner service role has **apply permissions** (e.g., `ec2:Create*`, `s3:Put*`).
- Enforce via **IAM policies** + AWS SSO/AWS Organizations.

---

### 3. **Remote State & Locks**

- Store state in **S3 + DynamoDB** (or Terraform Cloud).    
- Configure **state locking** so laptop applies canâ€™t override pipeline applies.
    

---

### 4. **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise (Optional)**

- Use **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise** with policy-as-code (Sentinel/OPA).    
- Enforce that all applies go through TFC â€” block CLI applies.
    

---

### 5. **Git Workflow**

- Infra changes must go through **PR reviews** â†’ pipeline â†’ controlled apply.    
- Protect `main` branch (no direct pushes).

## ðŸ”¹ Interview-Ready Answer (45 sec)

_"We ensure developers donâ€™t run `terraform apply` directly by restricting IAM permissions â€” developers have read-only or plan-only roles, while only our CI/CD pipeline role can apply changes. The Terraform state is stored remotely in S3 with DynamoDB locking, so even if someone tries locally, they canâ€™t override the pipeline. All infra changes go through pull requests, code review, and automated GitHub Actions pipelines. This enforces consistency, auditability, and prevents accidental production changes."_
